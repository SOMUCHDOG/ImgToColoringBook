<h1>A script I made to automate converting images to a pdf coloring book that is compatible with Amazon KDP.</h1>

To use...

*I am using MacOS and homebrew, you may need to use different commands for Window or Linux*

Install Python:
```
brew install python3
```

Install Pillow and reportLab
```
pip install Pillow reportLab
```

Upload images you want to convert into the folder. I used an aspect ratio of 3:4, I have not tested with other ratios.

Run the program!

```
python3 main.py
```
Should export as a pdf in the directory. :) Best of luck!
